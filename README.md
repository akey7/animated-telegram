Learning the basics of the Julia programming language and doing math-oriented programming with it.

## Dependencies

Since this repo is not yet a Julia package, it minimally needs the `Plots` package. Different folders of source code have their own dependencies. See the source code for details.

## Quarto

This repo uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html) as a rendering environment for Julia execution. Installation can be tricky, and requires Python as well as Julia to be configured correctly. See the preceding reference on installing support for Quarto.
